 Socket Programming in distributed system
-----------------------------------------
#Socket Programming Project for CS240, KAUST
##Introduction
A network socket is an endpoint of an inter-process communication across a computer network. Today, most communication between computers is based on the Internet Protocol\cite{SocketWiki}. \\
In this project we would learn about programming with sockets by utilizing both TCP and UDP connection between multi-clients and a server. Basically, we will mainly implement two programs: a server that listens for incoming connections and provides read and write access to a directory of files, and a client that users can run to connect to the server\cite{uchicago_project} , view the list of all active clients and communicate with some client without further help from the server after connected. Both the client and server would be written in C(C++) and operate under Linux/windows.
